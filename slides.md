# Jesus and the Law of Israel

## Session 9: Animal House

---
layout: statement

# Jesus denies the relevance of handwashing to the ritual purity of food, emphasizing that stricter attention to *moral* purity is needed.

# Said negatively, Jesus does not critique the Pharisees for leniency and then arbitrarily throw out an entire swath of commands.

# So, should Christians observe *kashrut*?

<!--
* If Jesus *didn't* declare all foods clean, does that mean that Christians are obligated by *kashrut*?
    * My answer to this is a definite "no."
    * However, we need to look in the right places for clear information on this.
    * Just because Jesus isn't clearly doing away with parts of Torah here doesn't mean there isn't more context to be had.
        * Acts 15 is much clearer on the relationship of gentile Christians to *kashrut* and Torah more generally.
* The point here is that if Jesus isn't making a sweeping claim about *kashrut* then we need to stop reading him as if he is.

# Acts 10:1--3
In Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of the Italian Cohort, as it was called.
He was a devout man who feared God with all his household; he gave alms generously to the people and prayed constantly to God.
One afternoon at about three o’clock he had a vision in which he clearly saw an angel of God\.\.\.\.

<!--
* This isn't just an example of a faithful, God-worshipping gentile.
    * Acts continues the pattern of extraordinarily pious centurions from Lk 7:1--10.
    * The Roman army was a thoroughly religious institution, with various divisions having their own particular loyalties to different deities.
        * It is remarkable, then, that a centurion would be described in these terms, i.e., not simply someone who worships God instead of idols, but someone who exemplifies Jewish piety and biblical justice.

# Acts 10:9--17
About noon the next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
He became hungry and wanted something to eat; and while it was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
He saw the heaven opened and something like a large sheet coming down, being lowered to the ground by its four corners.
In it were all kinds of four-footed creatures and reptiles and birds of the air.
Then he heard a voice saying, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat.”
But Peter said, “By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is profane or \[impure\].”
The voice said to him again, a second time, “What God has made \[pure\], you must not call profane.”
This happened three times, and the thing was suddenly taken up to heaven. 
Now while Peter was greatly puzzled about what to make of the vision that he had seen, suddenly the men sent by Cornelius appeared. 

<!--
* A few observations
    * First, Peter does not actually eat anything in this vision.
        * It is, after all, a vision.
        * The idea that Peter is violating *kashrut* for the first time in his life in this moment on the roof is simply incorrect.
    * Second, the language of *kill* implies sacrificial slaughter.
        * That is, Peter is being asked to offer these animals as sacrifices and then consume them as part of a sacrificial meal.
        * This idea can be seen in the use of the language of "profane" to describe the animals.
            * If we were talking about normal food, it would in fact be profane by default.
            * Peter's objection is that he has never eaten anything profane is nonsensical unless he is talking about sacrificial food.
                * Normal, everyday food may be ritually pure or impure, but not all normal food is fit for sacrifice.
    * Third, the sheet contains many different kinds of animals, both permitted and unpermitted.
        * Even some of the permitted animals would not have necessarily been appropriate for sacrifice.
        * The issue here is acceptability before God.
        * In the analogy presented in the vision, animals that were previously unsuitable for sacrifice are now acceptable.
            * Therefore, people who were previously unsuitable for inclusion in the covenant community are now acceptable and holy before God.

# God intends to _purify_ and _sanctify_ gentiles.

<!--
* Here I mean "sanctify" not in the technical soteriological sense, but in the sense of *making holy* or de-profanifying.
* Through the victory of the ascended Jesus and the coming of the Holy Spirit, gentiles are not only being purified from the defilement of idolatry, but *also* being set aside as holy before God.
    * A gentile can be pure from the defilement of sin and yet still not be holy in the way that Israel is holy.
    * This is changing.
* This entails a shift in demographic, not diet.
    * Peter's adherence to *kashrut* as a natural-born Israelite does not change.
