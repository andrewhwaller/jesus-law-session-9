# Jesus and the Law of Israel

## Session 9: Animal House

layout: statement

# Jesus denies the relevance of handwashing to the ritual purity of food, emphasizing that stricter attention to *moral* purity is needed.

# Said negatively, Jesus does not critique the Pharisees for leniency and then arbitrarily throw out an entire swath of commands.

# So, should Christians observe *kashrut*?

<!--
* If Jesus *didn't* declare all foods clean, does that mean that Christians are obligated by *kashrut*?
    * My answer to this is a definite "no."
    * However, we need to look in the right places for clear information on this.
    * Just because Jesus isn't clearly doing away with parts of Torah here doesn't mean there isn't more context to be had.
        * Acts 15 is much clearer on the relationship of gentile Christians to *kashrut* and Torah more generally.
* The point here is that if Jesus isn't making a sweeping claim about *kashrut* then we need to stop reading him as if he is.
